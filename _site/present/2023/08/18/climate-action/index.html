                                <div class="paper-desc">Empirical environment and behavior research has found that empathy improves environmental attitudes and behaviors. Emotionally persuasive icons (EPIs) show promise for creating empathy and for the design of effective eco-feedback technologies, particularly among children. Yet studies using these icons have focused on adults, with little research devoted to eco-feedback design for children. We explore the affective reactions to EPIs among children ages 9–11. To understand which types of EPIs generate the most empathy, we vary them in two dimensions: (1) metaphorical versus literal representations and (2) animal scenes versus environmental scenes. Our findings suggest that the impact of EPIs extends beyond metaphorical or literal images; to improve eco-feedback technologies that employ EPIs, designers must link the causes and effects of climate change to concrete, tangible actions that are associated with personal experiences, which could lead to stronger engagement and emotional responses among children. These results are consistent with the construal level theory of psychological distance, which is the cognitive and affective perception of how close or far something is. We extend this theory to sustainable HCI and contribute a space for future eco-feedback design among children.</div>

It underscores the critical need for SHCI to articulate clear sustainability goals and metrics, integrate knowledge from diverse disciplines, and navigate the tension between technological innovation and sustainability imperatives. The paper emphasizes the importance of broader collaboration and practical ethical considerations in addressing sustainability challenges. It proposes next steps for SHCI researchers, including specifying sustainability goals, considering longer time scales, and supporting systems in everyday use. Moreover, it identifies practical challenges and initiatives to foster more engaged and effective SHCI research. Ultimately, the paper calls for a collective reflection on the role of HCI in contributing to sustainability efforts and advocates for institutional changes to better support this endeavor.</div>

We also find that researchers have not thoroughly investigated how different households use these systems and how their uses differ from one another. We explore these questions in a 4-10 month field deployment of a social-energy monitoring application across 15 households, in two distinct locations. We contribute results that describe conditions under which these techniques were effective and ineffective. Our results imply that understanding factors such as a building, or community's layout, context knowledge of community members, accountability and adherence to social norms, trust, and length of residence are key for future design of social-energy applications.</div>

Urban residential households are among the primary consumers of resources and are deeply affected by resource shortages. Despite the global nature of these problems, most of the solutions being developed to address these issues are based on studies done in the developed world. We present a study of energy, water and fuel conservation practices in urban India. Our study highlights a culture of deep conservation and the results raise questions about the viability of typical solutions such as home energy monitors.

Resilient communities are characterized by strong social ties during emergencies, access to a wide range of resources, and availability of support. The least resilient communities consist of vulnerable populations such as the poor, the elderly, new residents, and those who are alone, or isolated as a result of homelessness. These populations often lack strong social ties as well as access to resources. The purpose of this paper is to spark discussion around ways in which HCI can position itself to build resilient communities, especially among vulnerable populations during times of disaster. Drawing from existing literature around disaster recovery and planning, social science, and crisis informatics, this paper poses new research questions for “post-sustainable” HCI.</div>

However, existing work typically focuses on moderately affluent homeowners who have relative autonomy with respect to their home, or does not address socio-economic status, class, and other related issues. For the 30% of the U.S. population who rent their homes, many key decisions regarding energy use must be negotiated with a landlord. Because energy use impacts the bottom line of both landlords and tenants, this can be a source of conflict in the landlord/tenant relationship. Ubicomp technologies for reducing energy use in rental units must engage with landlord/tenant conflicts to be successful. Unfortunately, little detailed knowledge is available about the impact of landlord/tenant conflicts on energy use. We present an analysis of a series of qualitative studies with landlords and tenants. We argue that a consideration of multiple stakeholders, and the power imbalances among them, will drive important new research questions and lead to more widely applicable solutions. The main contribution of our work is a set of open research questions and design recommendations for technologies that may affect and be affected by the conflict between stakeholders around energy use.</div>

Despite the attention paid to this area, few researchers have specifically explored these issues within a community that makes up approximately 30% of U.S. households – those below the federal poverty line. We present a study of 26 low-income households in two very different locations – a small town in the Southern U.S. and a northerly metropolitan area. Through a photo-elicitation study and directed interviews, we explore the relationship between energy saving behaviors, external factors, and users’ intrinsic values and beliefs. Most of our participants are committed to saving energy for non-financial reasons, even when not responsible for paying bills. Challenges to saving energy include safety and lack of control over the environment.

                                <div class="paper-desc">The greatest contributor of CO2 emissions in the average American household is personal transportation. Because transportation is inherently a mobile activity, mobile devices are well suited to sense and provide feedback about these activities. In this paper, we explore the use of personal ambient displays on mobile phones to give users feedback about sensed and self-reported transportation behaviors. We first present results from a set of formative studies exploring our respondents’ existing transportation routines, willingness to engage in and maintain green transportation behavior, and reactions to early mobile phone “green” application design concepts. We then describe the results of a 3-week field study (N=13) of the UbiGreen Transportation Display prototype, a mobile phone application that semi-automatically senses and reveals information about transportation behavior. Our contributions include a working system for semiautomatically tracking transit activity, a visual design capable of engaging users in the goal of increasing green transportation, and the results of our studies, which have implications for the design of future green applications.</div>
